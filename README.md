STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING LSTM:

Introduction:

In this code, we will use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to predict stock prices. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, such as time series forecasting.

Key Concepts:

LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory is a type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. It is particularly effective in capturing patterns and trends in time series data.
MinMaxScaler: A preprocessing technique used to scale numerical data to a specific range, in this case, between 0 and 1. Scaling the data helps improve the performance of the LSTM model.
Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the LSTM model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
Time Steps: The number of previous time steps used to predict the next time step. In this code, we set the time steps to 60, meaning the model will use the previous 60 days' closing prices to predict the next day's closing price.

Plot the actual and predicted stock prices.




NUMBER RECOGNITION using MNIST Dataset:

Introduction:

In this code, we will build a neural network model using the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

Key Concepts:

Neural Network:

  A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes called neurons that process and transmit information.

MNIST Dataset: 

The MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 pixel array, representing a digit from 0 to 9.

Preprocessing:

Preprocessing is the step of preparing the data for training a machine learning model. In this code, we reshape the input images and normalize the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.

Categorical Labels:

Categorical labels are used when the target variable has multiple classes. In this code, we convert the numerical labels of the digits to categorical labels using one-hot encoding.

Model Compilation:

Model compilation is the step of configuring the model for training. We specify the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics for the model.

Training: 

Training is the process of iteratively updating the model's parameters to minimize the loss function. We train the model using the training images and their corresponding labels.

Evaluation:

Evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of the trained model on unseen data. We evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing images and their labels.


Code Structure:

Import the necessary libraries: We import the required libraries for building and training the neural network model.

Load the MNIST dataset: We load the MNIST dataset using the mnist.load_data() function. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

Preprocess the data: We reshape the input images and normalize the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.

Convert the labels to categorical: We convert the numerical labels of the digits to categorical labels using one-hot encoding.

Create the model: We create a sequential model, which is a linear stack of layers. The model consists of two dense layers, one with 512 units and the other with 10 units.

Compile the model: We compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.

Train the model: We train the model using the training images and their corresponding labels.

Evaluate the model: We evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing images and their labels.
