Stock Price Prediction:

Introduction:

In this code, we will use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to predict stock prices. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, such as time series forecasting.

Key Concepts:

LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory is a type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. It is particularly effective in capturing patterns and trends in time series data.
MinMaxScaler: A preprocessing technique used to scale numerical data to a specific range, in this case, between 0 and 1. Scaling the data helps improve the performance of the LSTM model.
Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the LSTM model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
Time Steps: The number of previous time steps used to predict the next time step. In this code, we set the time steps to 60, meaning the model will use the previous 60 days' closing prices to predict the next day's closing price.

Code Structure:

Import the required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, MinMaxScaler, Sequential, LSTM, Dense.
Load the stock price data from a CSV file.
Preprocess the data by scaling the closing prices using MinMaxScaler.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Create the training and testing datasets by creating sequences of time steps.
Reshape the input data for LSTM.
Build the LSTM model using Sequential API.
Compile and train the model using the training data.
Make predictions using the trained model.
Inverse transform the predictions to obtain the actual stock prices.
Plot the actual and predicted stock prices.
